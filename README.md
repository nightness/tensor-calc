## A Rust-based Einstein Field Equation Solver

The first Rust-based Einstein field equation solver, bringing the memory safety and performance of Rust to spacetime physics with symbolic tensor calculus, automatic solution generation, and efficient computation.

### Key Features:
- First Rust-based Einstein equation solver (joining Python libraries like EinsteinPy and SageMath Manifolds)

## Mathematical Foundation

The implementation uses exact symbolic computation of Einstein's field equations:

### Einstein Field Equations:
```
G_ŒºŒΩ + Œõg_ŒºŒΩ = 8œÄT_ŒºŒΩ
```
Where:
- G_ŒºŒΩ = Einstein tensor (spacetime curvature)  
- Œõ = Cosmological constant (dark energy)
- T_ŒºŒΩ = Stress-energy tensor (matter/energy)

### Core Tensor Calculus Formulas:
- Christoffel symbols: `Œì^Œº_Œ±Œ≤ = (1/2) * g^ŒºŒΩ * (‚àÇg_ŒΩŒ≤/‚àÇx^Œ± + ‚àÇg_ŒΩŒ±/‚àÇx^Œ≤ - ‚àÇg_Œ±Œ≤/‚àÇx^ŒΩ)`
- Riemann tensor: `R^œÅ_œÉŒºŒΩ = ‚àÇŒì^œÅ_œÉŒΩ/‚àÇx^Œº - ‚àÇŒì^œÅ_œÉŒº/‚àÇx^ŒΩ + Œì^œÅ_ŒªŒº*Œì^Œª_œÉŒΩ - Œì^œÅ_ŒªŒΩ*Œì^Œª_œÉŒº`
- Einstein tensor: `G_ŒºŒΩ = R_ŒºŒΩ - (1/2) * g_ŒºŒΩ * R`
